# RoutineHelper
Designed primarily to make it easier for elementary age children to stick to a routine.  When a routine is set up, the tasks will be regenerated every day if the task is scheduled for that day.  There is a desktop component that announces the user and the task they need to complete.  When the task is complete, it can be checked off on the web app. The announcer will congratulate the user depending on how quickly they completed the task, as well as conditionally encourage them to complete the task "quickly" or "now".

## Future plans:
Integration with Google Home or Amazon Alexa, to allow tasks to be completed verbally.
